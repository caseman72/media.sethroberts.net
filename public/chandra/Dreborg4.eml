Dear Professor Strawbridge,

Yes you can be of help.

Thank very much for the detailed description of what has happened the last 
decade.



There is one circumstance I would like to point on.

After criticism of his work from all - Yes all well-known colleagues within 
the field - he wrote in a publication in 1997 / a follow up paper

"Double-blind placebo-controlled food challenges showed a lower prevalence 
of food allergy in the whey hydrolysate group compared with the other 
formula groups ..."

Paper:

R. K. Chandra. Five-year follow-up of high-risk infants with family history 
of allergy who were exclusively breast-fed or fed partial whey hydrolysate, 
soy, and conventional cow's milk formulas. J.Pediatr.Gastroenterol.Nutr. 24 
(4):380-388, 1997.



However, in the original article now challenges were reported., and his 
definitions of e.g. eczema and other atopic diseases were not adequate.



His studies are among the few concluding a beneficial effect of a partially 
hydrolysed whey formula from the company Nestlé. In general, even the other 
papers "documenting" this product by other authors have scientific flaws.



I can personally do whatever you ask me to do to investigate the case 
further.

I have great difficulties with scientific misconduct and lying.



If it can be of any help, I can probably gather some internationally well 
known pediatric allergists to go through his papers and point on if not 
misconduct at least bas science.



My question again:

Have you tried to get the protocols of the double blind food challenges made 
at follow up? I assume wyou will have difficulties to find them. Have the 
been stolen?



I take a copy to my frend Prof Arne Hoest of Odense Denmark



Together with hi, I participated in writing an extesive review on the 
dietary prevention of allergy>



In the third paper you can find soe data on the subject.

Dear Professor Dreborg,

Your letter to the Dean of Medicine has been handed to me for a
response.  The current dean has been in his position for only a short
while and knows very little of the matters surrounding Dr. Chandra.

On December 31, 1993 the clinical chief of Pediatrics at the pediatric
hospital where Dr. Chandra practiced wrote the (then) president of the
University alleging serious scientific misconduct on the part of Dr.
Chandra.  The allegations stemmed from things he had been told by a
research nurse working for Dr. Chandra.  Essentially, her claim was that
she saw the paper:

Chandra RK, Singh GK, Shridhara B.  Effect of feeding whey hydrolysate,
soy and conventional cow milk formulas on incidence of atopic disease in
high risk infants.  Annals Allergy 1989; 67:141-147

She claimed that whereas the paper had been published with 72 babies in
each of 4 groups, she had collected data on only 17 babies in the group
receiving the whey hydrolysate formula.

The president established a two-person panel of inquiry to see if there
were sufficient grounds to warrant a full investigation.  They concluded
there were sufficient grounds and a four-person committee of
investigation was established in April of 1994.  They interviewed more
than 50 people and looked at a large volume of documents.  In the course
of their investigation, Dr. Chandra could not provide ANY data.  He
claimed that the research nurse must have stolen it.

The committee made a preliminary report in August of 1994 which was
given to Dr. Chandra.  Soon thereafter, the chairman of the committee
became seriously ill and underwent several surgeries for a brain tumor.
In August of 1995, just as the committee was finalizing its report, Dr.
Chandra's lawyers submitted three large volumes of new information and
criticisms of the preliminary report.  Among the criticisms was an
allegation of bias on the part of one or more members of the committee.
Many, if not all, of the interviews of witnesses to the committee were
tape recorded.  Some, but not all, of the tapes were given to Dr.
Chandra's lawyer.  He claimed that when transcripts were made of the
tapes, they showed prejudicial comments being made by one or more
committee members to witnesses before they began their testimony.
Furthermore, he claimed that comparisons of the taped testimony of the
witnesses with what the preliminary report said about the testimony
showed that the committee had chosen only damaging aspects of the
testimony to use in the report and ignored positive aspects.  There were
also two sworn statements from technicians who did blood collecting and
analysis.  Their estimates of the number of samples collected and
analyzed were consistent with the number of babies in the published
study.

The final report, without seeing the new information from the lawyer,
concluded that misconduct had occurred.

The president, after a further four months of legal consultations and
having obtained advice from a retired professor of Medicine, wrote Dr.
Chandra saying the University was ending the investigation and that
there was not sufficient evidence to go further "at this time".

Although this entire affair was handled as discreetly as possible, of
course the whispers spread.  They reached you in Sweden.

Other allegations of fraud were made against Dr. Chandra for work he
published in Nutrition on a multivitamin (for which he held the patent)
and its positive effects on lowering infections and improving mental
functioning in the elderly.  This was in 2001.  Subsequently, Nutrition
retracted that paper and published an article stating eight reasons why
they had done so.  Interestingly, when we asked for his raw data, this
time he blamed the Faculty of Medicine for losing it or stealing it when
his office was moved.  He retired August 2, 2002.

On January 31, February 1 and February 2 of 2006 the Canadian Broadcast
Corporation showed a three-part documentary called "The Secret Life of
Dr. Chandra" which painted him as not only committing scientific fraud
but also claimed he had 120 bank accounts scattered around the world
with more than $2 million (Canadian) in them.  They portrayed the
University as having covered up his fraud.

.pdf

In summary:  There are reasons to be suspicious about the infant formula
studies (there were follow-ups of the babies) but there is no definitive
proof of wrongdoing.  However, in my personal view, there is every
reason to suspect that the data were invented for the study on the
multivitamins and the elderly.

If I can be of any further help, please let me know.
